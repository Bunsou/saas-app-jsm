# Clerk Authentication Setup

Your Next.js App Router application is now configured with Clerk authentication! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Clerk Credentials

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application (if you haven't already)
3. Copy your credentials from the API Keys section

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Clerk credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (your actual publishable key)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (your actual secret key)
```

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Run your development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

3. Try signing up/signing in using the buttons in the navbar

4. Visit protected pages like `/companions/new` to see authentication in action
